This project provides the solution faced by many  governments as well as individuals by harnessing the power of decentralized ledger technology. 

First it will provide technical capability by introducing cutting edge technology to the masses. This will ensure that the IT infrastructure / development costs to most underdeveloped countries is low as it will provide an out-of-box solution for implementing all the relevant modules. The vanilla implementation of this solution should be capable enough to solve most of the problems mentioned previously.

Second, it will create transparency and reduce  the turn-around-time of sharing the documents. Any document, when created, will automatically be visible to all stakeholders who are subscribed to the chain.
